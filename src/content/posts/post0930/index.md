## TL;DR

- On local Windows PC: Search for **Remote Desktop Connection** in Windows Search. Type the name of the PC you want to connect to, and select Connect.

- On macOS device: Download and open the [Windows App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/windows-app/id1295203466?mt=12) (previously named Microsoft Remote Desktop). Add the name of the PC you want to connect to.
